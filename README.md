# Anaemia-Type-Prediction
 This project predicts the type of Anaemia in patients using machine learning techniques, specifically the XGBoost algorithm and a Sacking Ensemble Classifier.. After preprocessing the data , we apply XGBoost—a powerful gradient boosting framework known for its accuracy and efficiency—as a base model.
